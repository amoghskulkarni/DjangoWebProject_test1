1. Audience

Raven Lite has been developed primarily as an interactive sound visualization 
tool for novice through advanced users who want to visualize sound in 
exciting ways.

This README pertains to the elements of Raven Lite for both the Mac OS X and 
Windows platforms. For specific information regarding registering your 
license, see 4.2 Registering a license.


2. System Requirements
  

Raven Lite 1.0 for Windows requires a PC running the Windows 98SE, Windows Me, 
Windows 2000,Windows XP Home, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista 
operating system with a processor running at 500 MHz or higher (1.0 GHz or 
higher recommended), and 256 MB of RAM.  The required version 1.5 of Java is 
automatically installed with Raven Lite.

Raven Lite 1.0 for Mac OS X requires a Macintosh computer with at least 256 MB 
of RAM, running Mac OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) or higher and Apple Java 1.4.1 
or higher. We recommend Mac OS X version 10.3 (Panther) or higher because some 
customers running version 10.2 have had difficultly downloading Apple Java 1.4.x 
using software update. We recommend a 400 MHz G4 processor or faster for running 
Raven Lite.

For both platforms, you must have write permission to the folder where Raven Lite 
is to be installed, both during installation and when running Raven Lite. Raven Lite 
can download updates that need to be written to disk. Therefore, Raven Lite must 
be able to write in the folder where it is installed.
 
If you find that Raven Lite feels sluggish on your computer, please consult the 
performance tips listed below in 4.3 Raven Lite Performance Tips.


 
3. Installation Instructions

Download one or more installers from the Raven Lite web site.  If you have a high
speed connection, then we recommend that you download the single installer 
containing all Raven Lite programs, documentation, and examples.  If you have a 
dial-up connection, then you might want to download the installer for the examples
separately.

You can run the installer and accept all defaults to install Raven Lite.
Raven Lite is installed to a single folder, usually "/Applications/Raven Lite 1.0" on 
Mac OS X and "C:\Program Files\Raven Lite 1.0" on Windows. You can use Raven Lite 
alongside Raven to compare features. 

On Windows and Mac OS X, Raven Lite uses QuickTime from Apple Computer to
open certain types of files, like MP3 and AIFC format.  In addition, on Mac OS X,
Raven Lite uses QuickTime to open tracks from audio CDs.

QuickTime comes installed on Mac OS X, but computers running Windows will need 
to have QuickTime installed on them. Windows users should visit the Raven Lite
QuickTime Install page at 
http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/RavenLite/QuickTimeInstall.html, then download and 
run the QuickTime installer. Choose the Custom button on the QuickTime installer, 
then mark the checkbox for "QuickTime for Java", then finish the installation. 
For those Windows users who already have QuickTime or iTunes installed, run 
QuickTimeUpdater.exe from the C:\Program Files\QuickTime folder, then press 
the Custom button, mark the checkbox for "QuickTime for Java", then click the 
"Update Now" button to finish the installation.




3.1 Contents of the Raven Lite folder
  
After you've installed Raven Lite, your Raven Lite directory should include:

  o Raven Lite 1.0, the Raven Lite application on Mac OS X and a shortcut on Windows
 
  o readme.txt, this readme file in text format.
  
  o readme.htm, this readme file in HTML format.
 
  
3.2 Contents of the Raven Lite/Documentation subfolder
  

Within the Raven Lite folder, the Documentation subfolder will 
contain the Raven Lite User's Guide and Quick Start Guide, provided as 
Portable Document Format (PDF) files. You can access these files from within the
application by looking in the Raven Lite Help menu.  You will need to have the 
free Adobe Reader program installed to read the manual.  Adobe Reader is available 
at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html. 

For Mac OS X users, we recommend using Adobe Reader for viewing the manual, 
rather than Preview, which is supplied as part of Mac OS X. The manual 
includes hyperlink navigation aids that are not supported by Preview.

 
3.3 Contents of the Raven Lite/Examples subfolder
 
Within the Raven Lite folder, the Examples subfolder contains sound files that 
can be opened and explored until users are able to provide their own sounds
from audio CDs or other sources.
  


 
4. Running Raven Lite
  

4.1 Launching Raven Lite
 
To launch Raven Lite for Windows, double-click on the "Raven Lite 1.0" 
shortcut in the Raven Lite folder, or choose the Raven Lite item in the 
Start Menu program group.

To launch Raven Lite for Mac OS X, double-click on the "Raven Lite 1.0" 
application in the Finder.
 

4.2 Registering a license

To receive a free license for Raven Lite, you can either visit the web site
at http://RavenSoundSoftware.com/, click on Free Licenses, then click on the link
that says "get a free license", or you can start Raven Lite and choose
"Get a Free License" from the Help menu.

When you request a license for Raven Lite, you will be given a license serial 
number to be used on the Raven Lite registration dialog. The serial number will 
be sent to you via email. The registration dialog will be presented to you when 
you launch Raven Lite. You can copy the serial number from the email to the 
system clipboard, paste it into the dialog using the Paste button, and then 
press the Register button to register. You can also choose to run Raven Lite 
in demo mode by pressing the "Run Demo" button on the dialog, after which you 
should select the "Register..." menu item on the Help menu to register a license. 
You will be asked to enter the license serial number as described above. 
Once you are registered, Raven Lite will attempt to download any files it needs 
to update to the latest level.


4.3 Raven Lite Performance Tips

  o Real-time recorder displays can tax a computer's CPU, especially on 
    slower computers. If necessary, you can reduce the load placed on your 
    CPU by these displays by making them smaller and/or hiding their axes. 
  


4.4 Troubleshooting Problems

If you notice any problems while running Raven Lite, there are a couple of ways 
to gather information to report to the Raven Lite team. 

The first is to see if any information has been written to the console. 
On Windows, that means running with the Raven Lite Console. There is a shortcut 
provided to the Raven Lite Console when Raven Lite is installed. There is also a 
file called RavenLiteConsole.bat in the Raven Lite directory. Double-clicking on 
this file will launch Raven Lite with a Java console to allow additional 
program output to be written to this console. If you report a problem, 
please include any information that you see in the console. On Mac OS X, 
there is a separate application located in /Applications/Utilities called 
Console. If you launch this application, it will show Raven Lite output along 
with other output generated by the operating system.

Information can be sent to the Raven Lite support team by visiting the Raven
Help web site at http://ravenhelp.ornith.cornell.edu/forum/.

The second way to provide information to the Raven Lite support team is if
Raven Lite encounters an unrecoverable error.  If this happens, Raven Lite will
ask you to provide your email address and a description of what you were doing
when the error occurred.  Please fill in the information and press the OK button
to send the information to the Raven Lite support team.  By using the tool 
provided within Raven Lite, you are providing much more information than by just 
sending an email or going to ravenhelp.ornith.cornell.edu.  This is because 
Raven Lite is able to gather a lot of information about the program environment 
in the report that it generates.
